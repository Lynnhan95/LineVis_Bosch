        <h2 class='sub-title'>Data Representation</h2>
        <p>There are two key KPIs in the assembly line visualization dashboard, <strong>Scrap Condition</strong> and <strong>First Pass Yield</strong>, as essential features in measuring
            the performance of multiple assemly plants and lines. <br>
            According to the given dataset, a high scrap rate represents for a bad production performance,
            while the total production numbers stands for the maximum ability in producing certain kinds of products. Therefore, I choose bar chart and pie chart
            to visualize each KPI. The same logic could be applied to First Pass Yield.
        </p>
        <h2 class='sub-title'>UI Elements</h2>
        <p>In order to interact with the dashboard, here are some UI elements to notice:<br>
            1.Tags: Use the tags on top of the dashboard to toggle between multiple KPIs.<br>
            2.Filter: For example, in Scrap Condition dashboard, there is filter with two options:1(Good Part) with red label and 2(Scrap Part) with blue filter. You may click on each filter to focus on the feature you care about.<br>
            3.Shadow: When you hover you mouse over each bar/ pie chart, you will notice a shadow followed, which indicates the area you probably need to focus on<br>
            4.Tooltip: Tooltips display the data according to which part you are interacting with, in terms of number, or percentage.
        </p>
        <h2 class='sub-title'>Future works</h2>
        <p>This is a huge dataset! There are so many dimensions we can focus on. Now I mainly focus on scrap rate and first pass yield, in the futhure, we could find something even more interesting, for example: does the manufacturing efficiency get influenced by date?</p>
